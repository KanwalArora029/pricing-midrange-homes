# Flatiron School Project 1
## Pricing Midrange Homes in King County, Washington


### Description
This repository contains files from a project assigned to me as part of Flatiron School's Online Data Science Bootcamp. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate skills in data cleaning and multiple linear regression modeling.

Here's what you'll find inside:
- **kreiger-project-1.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing project code
- **column_names.md**: Markdown file containing the data dictionary for the dataset provided by Flatiron School
- **kc_house_data.csv**: CSV file containing the dataset provided by Flatiron School
- **presentation.pdf**: PDF file containing slides from a non-technical presentation of project results

### Technical specifications
I created the Jupyter Notebook in a virtual environment provided to me by Flatiron School. Things may work a little differently for you if you're running different versions of Python or the packages I used.

If you download the notebook to view locally, note that I formatted it using Jupyter Notebook extensions (https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions). The extensions let me easily create a table of contents and collapse groups of cells to make the notebook easier to read and navigate. If you don't have the extensions installed locally, the notebook will look a little different for you.

### Authorship
Flatiron School provided me the dataset, the data dictionary, a Jupyter Notebook containing only a rubric for recording my identifying information, and the code I used for stepwise selection. I wrote the rest of the code in the Jupyter Notebook, the text of this README, my blog post linked above, and the content of my non-technical presentation (with the exception of some images whose creators I credit in the slides).
